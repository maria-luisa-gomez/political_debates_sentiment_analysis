Donald Trump,3,05:34,Thank you Joe,11,us_election_2020_1st_presidential_debate,thank joe
Joe Biden,2,05:36,The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States Theyre not going to get that chance now because were in the middle of an election already The election has already started Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because thats the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President,12,us_election_2020_1st_presidential_debate,american people right supreme court nominee occur vote united states senators vote president united states go chance middle election election start ten thousand people vote thing happen wait wait outcome election s way american people express view elect president elect vice president
Joe Biden,2,06:12,Now whats at stake here is the Presidents made it clear he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act Hes been running on that he ran on that and hes been governing on that Hes in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now if it goes into court And the justice Im not opposed to the justice she seems like a very fine person But shes written before she went in the bench which is her right that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional The other thing thats on the court and if its struck down what happens Womens rights are fundamentally changed Once again a woman could pay more money because she has a preexisting condition of pregnancy Theyre able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets,13,us_election_2020_1st_presidential_debate,s stake presidents clear want rid affordable care act s run run s govern s supreme court right try rid affordable care act strip million people have health insurance go court justice m oppose justice like fine person s write go bench right think affordable care act constitutional thing s court strike happen womens right fundamentally change woman pay money preexist condition pregnancy able charge woman exact procedure man get
Joe Biden,2,07:08,And that ended when we in fact passed the Affordable Care Act and theres a hundred million people who have preexisting conditions and theyll be taken away as well Those preexisting conditions insurance companies are going to love this And so its just not appropriate to do this before this election If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican then he goes forward If not we should wait until February,14,us_election_2020_1st_presidential_debate,end fact pass affordable care act s million people preexist condition ll take away preexist condition insurance company go love appropriate election win election senate republican go forward wait february
Donald Trump,3,07:34,There arent a hundred million people with preexisting conditions As far as a say is concerned the people already had their say Okay Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully very strongly at some point 10 years ago or so she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time but a President is elected for four years Were not elected for three years Im not elected for three years So we have the Senate we have a President,15,us_election_2020_1st_presidential_debate,nt million people preexist condition far concerned people okay justice ginsburg say powerfully strongly point year ago say president senate elect period time president elect year elect year m elect year senate president
